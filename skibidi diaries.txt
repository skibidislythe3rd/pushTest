one day, I had skibidi slicers with blueberry pancakes and muesli with strawberry filing and gelato with a cherry on top.



the next day, I had sigma meals for my lunch and I got chicken sigma skibidi chop with grilled skibidi salmon and a cherry on top.



and during midnight, I sneaked out of my skibidi room and cooked up some wild rabbits with rats and some raspberry skibidi sauce with some left over mc donalds and I cant forgret the cherry on top.



the next morning, I cooked myself a oui oui bagyatttttttt level 10 with again a cherry on top.
